# My Roadmap.sh Projects

This repository contains the projects I have completed while following [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh) learning paths.  
Each project is contained in its own folder with a dedicated README describing the project, installation, usage, and other details.

## Projects

### 1. GitHub User Activity CLI
- A simple command-line application to fetch and display recent public activity of a GitHub user using the GitHub API.
- Project page: [GitHub User Activity](https://roadmap.sh/projects/github-user-activity)
- Folder: `Github_API_Project`

### 2. Task Tracker CLI
- A CLI tool to manage tasks locally with add, update, delete, and status tracking features.
- Project page: [Task Tracker](https://roadmap.sh/projects/task-tracker)
- Folder: `task-cli_project`

*More projects will be added as I continue following the roadmap.sh paths.*

## Notes
- Each project is beginner-friendly and self-contained.
- Node.js (v18+) is generally required for CLI projects.
- Refer to the README in each project folder for detailed instructions.
